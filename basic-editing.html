    <h1>Basic Image Editing</h1>
    <p>
      It is good practice when taking images from a digital camera or phone to
      do some basic editing before storing them. The steps involved in this
      are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Decide whether you want to keep the image or if you are going to
        delete it
      </li>
      <li>Crop the image if necessary</li>
      <li>Resize the image if necessary</li>
      <li>
        Adjust the colour balance using the <strong>Levels</strong> adjustment
        tool
      </li>
      <li>Sharpen the image if necessary</li>
      <li>Save the image using a descriptive name as a jpeg or png</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Most of these steps are covered in some detail below.</p>
    <h2>Crop the Image</h2>
    <p>
      Cropping is used to remove unwanted areas of an image and emphasise the
      part(s) you want the viewer to concentrate on. Below is an image that
      shows a cropping grid over an image. Adjusting the edges of the grid so
      one of its crosspoints is over the part you want to emphasise/draw the
      eye to is the aim. Research has shown that the human eye is naturally
      drawn to these areas of an image. In the image it can be seen that the
      seashell is intended to be the subject because of where the lines
      intersect. Clicking on the image will open an article on the "Rule of
      Thirds" that is involved cropping method. Unfortunately Photopea does
      not show a grid when the cropping tool is being used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are two images showing the cropping tool in action. Note the
      cropping grid has small squares at its corners and in the middle of each
      side. These can be clicked on and dragged by the mouse to adjust the
      cropping area. Once the cropping grid is correct, pressing the Enter key
      will make the crop. Note there are additional options in the cropping
      tool's options bar. For instance the "Tick" or "Cross" can be used to
      confirm or exit the crop. Experiment with these.

    <h2>Image Resizing</h2>
    <p>
      The next step is to resize the image if you think it is too big. Too big
      is a matter of opinion. For example if you are emailing the image you
      may want it to have a width of say 600 pixels. If you are storing it on
      your computer and you have plenty of disk space you could be happy with
      a width of 2000 pixels. The example image used below has a width of 2000
      pixels so could be resized to a width of 600 pixels for emailing
      purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Levels (adjusting dynamic range of colours)</h2>
    <p>
      The levels dialog allows the dynamic range of colours to be adjusted.
      The goal is to have a better spread across the colour spectrum. The
      histogram in the dialog shows the spread of pixels from dark on the
      left-hand end to light on the right. The square handles below the
      histogram can be dragged to adjust the range spread. The rule of thumb
      is to adjust the handles so they are below the point where the histogram
      "mountain" starts to climb. In the images below you can see that the
      left-hand end one can be moved right a little and this improves the
      richness of the image's colour. The middle handle adjusts the middle
      tones of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handles below the slider bar allow the amount of light and dark
      pixels that will be in the adjusted image to be altered. For example, if
      the left-hand one is dragged right some of the darker pixels will be
      discarded so the image as a whole will be lightened. This is one way of
      creating a watermark image.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharpen the image</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the quality of the camera that takes an image, and to a
      lesser extent the focus point, an image can lack definition. Also,
      resizing an image can cause lack of definition or fuzziness as well. If
      this is the case then sharpening can be beneficial. Put simply,
      sharpening takes the difference between neighbouring dark and light
      pixels and extenuates it. This has the effect of making the image "pop"
      or standout more. The images below show how to sharpen an image. Note
      that there are three sharpening tools. Using the "Unsharp mask" one
      gives most control.
    </p>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">
      <img loading="lazy" src="./img/basic-editing/sharpening-menu.jpg" alt="The sharpening menu items" />
      <figcaption>The sharpening tools menu</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">
      <img loading="lazy" src="./img/basic-editing/sharpening-dialog.jpg" alt="The unsharp mask dialog" />
      <figcaption>The Unsharp mask dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Unsharp mask dialog has three adjustments. The
      <strong>Amount</strong> slider controls how much sharpness is applied.
      The <strong>Radius</strong> controls how many neighbouring pixels are
      involved in how much each pixel is sharpened. The
      <strong>Threshold</strong> controls at what point sharpening starts.
      This is to allow small imperfections in an image to remain unsharpened
      and so not stand out. It is best to leave the Radius and Threshold
      settings at their default. The second image above shows that the image
      has been sharpened by 50%. This figure does not equate to an exact value
      as it is possible to sharpen an image more than 100%. As 50% is quite a
      low value the effect on the image is slight, though there is a
      noticeable better definition of the lion's coat.
    </p>
    <h2>Saving the Image</h2>
    <p>
      Once all the adjustments have been made the image can be saved. It may
      be a good idea to save the adjusted image in a different folder to the
      one in which the original image came from. Images should be
      descriptively named. When ready to save an image choose "Export as"
      under the "File" menu on the main menu bar. A flyout menu will appear
      giving file type options. Choose "jpg" for multi-coloured images e.g.
      photos, or "png" if you want all image data to be saved. This is because
      the jpeg storage format always throws away some image data in order to
      lower the file size (its lossey), whereas png preserves data (lossless).
    </p>
    <p>
      >Once the Save dialog opens a preview of the image will appear in the
      dialog at left (zoom can be adjusted by rolling the middle mouse wheel).
      The preview is live so changes to dialog settings, e.g. Quality, will
      update in real time. Underneath this the image zoom level is shown as
      well as the current "save" file size of the image according to what: 1)
      file type/format has been chosen; 2) its width and height (this can be
      changed to resize the image); 3) quality setting - adjusting this
      effects both the file size and the image's quality. Once you are happy
      with the settings click Save and by default the image will be saved in
      the web browser's default Downloads folder.
