      <h1>Introduction to Photopea</h1>
      <p>
        Below is an image of Photopea with labels that indicate the most
        important parts of its interface. Here is a link to a tutorial written
        by its developer that explains how to use it:

      <h2>Menu bar</h2>
      <p>
        The menu bar is similar to that used in other applications in that the
        item names are fairly explainatory e.g. File, Edit. Clicking on an menu
        item will cause a dropdowm menu to appear. In turn some of these have
        sub-menues.
      </p>
      <h2>Selected tool Options bar</h2>
      <p>
        When a tool is selected its options will be displayed in the
        <strong>Selected tool options</strong> toolbar.
      </p>
      <h2>Editing tools</h2>
      <p>
        The Editing tools allow you to manipulate images in many ways. The
        graphic for each tool gives and indication of its purpose e.g. a brush
        icon indicates the brush tool. Also, if you hover over a tool for a
        second or so a notice will pop up showing the tool's name. Some icons
        have a small arrow at their bottom right corner. This indicates that
        there are more (hidden) options. These can be seen by clicking on the
        small arrow.
      </p>
      <h2>Image display area</h2>
      <p>
        This is where the image (or parts of it) being worked on is displayed.
        Any changes that you make to the image will appear here in real time.
      </p>
      <h2>Collapsible information dialogs</h2>
      <p>
        When working on an image clicking on these buttons will cause a dialog
        to fly out. The dialogs display various properties and can be used to
        fine-tune some of the tool effects e.g. The
        <strong>Cha</strong> or Character and paragraph dialog allows the
        spacing between text characters to be adjusted when working with a text
        layer.
      </p>
      <h2>History dialog</h2>
      <p>
        The History dialog displays in an ordered list all the steps you have
        taken when working on an image. The latest change will be at the bottom.
        To revert to the open state of the image click on the item at the very
        top of the list. Clicking on any item will cause the image to revert its
        state. The key combination Ctrl+z (or Command+z on a Mac) is a quick way
        to step back one step in history. Ctrl+y redoes an undone move.
      </p>
      <h2>Layers, blending modes, and opacity dialog</h2>
      <p>
        You will find yourself working a lot with this dialog. An image can be
        worked on using a layering approach. Image layers can be likened to
        layers in a cake. An image as a whole is a combination of its layers and
        the effect they contribute. Layers can be used in many creative ways. It
        is best to learn their use through practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many available blending modes. Blending modes work by
        integrating the layer that has the blending mode set on it with those
        below it. For example they can be used to strengthen an image (multiply
        blending mode), and tint an image (screen or overlay mode).
      </p>
      <p>
        The opacity control adjusts the "see-throughness" of the layer that is
        selected. This can be used to fine-tune a blending effect.
      </p>
