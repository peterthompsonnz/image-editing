            <img style="float:left; margin-right:3rem;width:32px;height:219px"

            <p>
                It is often the case that you just want to work with a part of an image rather than the whole thing.
                Photopea has a good range
                of selection tools that allow you to do this. The image on the left shows the tool buttons. Note that
                each tool button
                has a small arrow at its bottom right corner that can be clicked to see the tools in that group. The
                buttons in order are:
                1) the rectangle and ellipse select tools; 2) the lasso tools; 3) the magic wand and quick select tools.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Rectangle and Ellipse Select Tools</h2>
        <h3>Rectangle</h3>
        <p>
            To use this tool click to the top left of the area of the image you want selected then drag down diagonally
            to the bottom
            right and release the mouse button. The selection can be seen to be active by the dashed line around it. The
            centre of the selection can be clicked on and the selection moved by dragging if
            necessary. <br>To remove the selection press the key combination <strong>Ctr-d</strong> or use the
            <strong>Select</strong> menu in the main menu toolbar (Select -> Deselect).</p>
        <p>The tool has a number of options.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Feathering: the selection is blurred in that some pixels are indefinitely selected leading to a gradual
                transition
                from fully selected pixels to unselected ones. The granularity of the change is determined
                by the value used in the feathering.</li>
            <li>Constraints: the drawing of the selection is totally Free(hand); a set Ratio (e.g. 4 to 3, 16 to 9), a
                specific
                Size (e.g. 600 x 480 pixels)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Add to, Subtract from, Intersect with, and Difference from selection options</h3>
        <p>It is possible to fine-tune a selection using the options bar buttons. The image below shows how the bar
            looks when
            any of the selection tools are active. The numbers 1 to 5 have been added to the image for explanatory
            purposes.</p>
        <figure class="image-side-by-side">

            <figcaption>The options bar for the selection tools</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>No. 1</strong> button is the default option. This means if you select part of an image, and then
                another
                part the first part will be deselected. In other words, it is only possible to have one area selected
                at once.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>No. 2</strong> button allows for more than one area to be selected (Add to), and they do not
                need to overlap.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>No. 3</strong> button allows for part of a selected area to be removed by selecting the part
                that is to be
                removed (Subtract from).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>No. 4</strong> button means if two selections overlap, just the overlapping areas will be
                selected (Intersect
                with).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No. 5</strong> button means if two selections overlap, just the areas that
                <strong>do not</strong> overlap will be selected (Difference from).</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Below are some examples of using options 2 and 3. Read the image captions for more information.</p>

        <div class="hr"></div>
        <h3>Ellipse</h3>
        <p>
            The Ellipse tool works in the same way as the rectangular one except the selection shape is elliptical. The
            two images below
            show the selection being 1) applied, and 2) moved using the Move tool. Note that when the selection is moved
            the
            blurred feathered edge can be seen and also the checkerboard pattern that indicates that the area where the
            selection
            was is now transparent. <br>To remove the selection press the key combination <strong>Ctr-d</strong> or use
            the <strong>Select</strong> menu in the main menu toolbar (Select -> Deselect).

        <h2>The Lasso Tools</h2>
        <h3>Lasso</h3>
        <p>
            The lasso tool allows you to draw freehand to make a selection. The selection can be feathered and releasing
            the mouse button
            at any point will close the selection. This tool can be used to make a quick selection that does not need to
            be too accurate. <br>To remove the selection press the key combination <strong>Ctr-d</strong> or use the
            <strong>Select</strong> menu in the main menu toolbar (Select -> Deselect).
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Polygonal Lasso</h3>
        <p>
            The Polygonal Lasso tool allows you to make a selection around an angular shape by clicking at its corners.
            Double-clicking at any point will close the selection. It is best to use this tool when the shape
            being selected is well defined. It can make a more accurate selection than the ordinary Lasso tool, but is
            usually
            not as accurate as the Magnetic lasso. <br>To remove the selection press the key combination
            <strong>Ctr-d</strong> or use the <strong>Select</strong> menu in the main menu toolbar (Select ->
            Deselect).
        </p>

            <figcaption>Using the Polygonal lasso tool</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Magnetic Lasso</h3>
        <p>
            The Magnetic Lasso will attempt to follow a shape as you trace around it with the mouse. It is best to use
            this tool when
            the shape being selected is well defined. Note however that the shape does not need to be angular. The
            starting
            point of the selection needs to be clicked and then the mouse button can be released and the mouse moved to
            trace
            the shape being selected. At points around the tracing anchor points can be added by clicking. Feathering
            can
            be done and double-clicking at any point will close the selection. <br>To remove the selection press the key
            combination <strong>Ctr-d</strong> or use the <strong>Select</strong> menu in the main menu toolbar (Select
            -> Deselect).
        </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <h2>The Magic Wand and Quick Select</h2>
        <h3>Magic Wand</h3>
        <p>
            The Magic Wand is very useful when you want to select large areas that have very similar colours. To use it:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the tool by clicking on it - there is an icon that looks like a wand on its button in the editing
                tools
                toolbar.
            </li>
            <li>Set the feather value to a number above 0 if a fuzzy edge to the selection is wanted.</li>
            <li>Set the Tolerance - this number governs the range of pixels that are selected. A low number means
                stricter selections,
                a higher number means looser selections. A value of 21 is a good number to start with.</li>
            <li>Tick/untick the Contiguous checkbox - when ticked the selection will spread out from the original
                "clicked" point,
                like ripples on a pond, only stopping when a definite colour boundary is reached.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The image below shows a selection that was made when the pink bonnet of the car was clicked somewhere near
            its centre.
        </p>

        <figure class="image-side-by-side">
            <img loading="lazy" src="./img/using-selections/magic-wand.jpg"
                alt="A selection made using the magic wand tool">
            <figcaption>A selection made using the magic wand tool. Note that some areas have not been selected due to
                them being outside
                the colour range tolerance</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>When the wand does not select all of an area that you want it to select the "Add to selection" button in the
            options
            bar and continues clicking on the areas you need selected. The image below shows all the car's pink colour
            selected.</p>
        <figure class="image-side-by-side">
            <img loading="lazy" src="./img/using-selections/magic-wand2.jpg"
                alt="All the car's pink colour selected using the magic wand tool">
            <figcaption>All the car's pink colour selected using the Magic Wand tool and the "Add to" option
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <h3>Quick Select</h3>
        <p>
            The Quick Select tool (which lives with the Magic Wand) is useful for quickly selecting similar colours. It
            uses a brush
            to select colours. To use it select the brush size and hardness and then drag across the areas you want
            selected.
            In the image below the selection of the pink colour is not complete. Note the "Unite" and "Subtract" buttons
            on the options bar. They serve a similar purpose to the "Add to" and "Subtract from" Magic Wand buttons.</p>
        <p>Also note the Refine Edges button.
            <strong>This is an advanced tool</strong>. Clicking on it will open a new dialog where selection edges can
            be fine-tuned
            by painting them with white, grey or black colours. White removes the selection painted, black adds to it,
            and
            grey is similar to white in its operation but is not so severe. In addition the selection border can be
            increased.
            Finally the selection can be saved as a New Layer (the default), a path (a vector line), or a selection.
        </p>
