    <h1>About Images</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      When an image is displayed on a screen it is represented by a
      rectangular block of small squares called "pixels". This is also
      referred to as a "Bitmap". The word pixel is a contraction of the two
      words "Picture element". The pixels are arranged in a grid containing
      rows and columns. Each pixel is coloured (though some can be transparent
      - more on this later) and this colour is made up of a mix of red, green
      and blue. This is known as the RGB colour system, and it is the one that
      monitors and screens use. Each of these component colours can have a
      strength that is represented by a number between 0 and 255. A value of 0
      means there is no amount of colour; a value of 255 means the colour is
      at full strength. Therefore the number of different colour shades is red
      strengths x green strengths x blue stregths or 255 x 255 x 255 =>
      16,581,375. Pixels are quite small and usually can not be seen unless
      the image they are a part of is magnified or zoomed. Below is an
      original image of a train and the area around the light that has been
      zoomed. The pixels can be clearly seen around the edge of the light.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Part of image zoomed <br />showing pixels</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      It can also be seen that the curved line at the edge of the light is
      actually made up of 3 or 4 lines of pixels, each of a different colour.
      This effect is called anti-aliasing and is used to cope with the fact
      that it is hard to represent curved lines with groups of square blocks.
      Taken together the effect is to blend the colour transition.
    </p>

    <h2>Resolution or screen definition</h2>
    <p>
      Every image has a resolution. This is the width and height of the image
      in pixels. For example the first train image has a width of 600 pixels
      and a height of 337 pixels. The actual size that the image takes up on a
      device's screen is governed by its resolution. This is the number of
      pixels per inch that the screen displays. A typical computer desktop
      monitor has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch (in both the horizontal
      and vertical directions). Inches are typically used rather than
      centimetres or millimetres for historical reasons to do with printing.
      This means that the 600 by 337 image will take up a space of 600/72 by
      337/72 or 8.33 by 4.68 inches, or 21.16cm by 11.89cm on a typical
      desktop monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast a mobile phone such as the Moto G3 has a much higher
      resolution. In its case it is 294ppi (pixels per inch). This means that
      the 600 by 337 image ideally will take up a space of 600/294 by 337/294
      or 2.05 by 1.15 inches, or 5.21cm by 2.92cm. I write ideally because
      there are several other factors that determine how big an image will be
      displayed at, such as what styles the creator of the page has set for
      image display.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high resolutions of mobile phones result in sharper images due to
      the smaller pixel size. This makes curved lines more defined and
      crisper. It also allows for images or text to be zoomed with a smaller
      loss of clarity than a lower resolution screen would allow for.
    </p>
    <h2>Image formats</h2>
    <p>
      This section is quite technical, but will be useful when learning about
      saving images in different image formats when using Photopea. Don't
      worry if you do not understand it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, an image displayed on a screen is a rectangular grid
      of coloured pixels. Each pixel's colour is made up of a combination of
      various strengths of red, green and blue. This is called the RGB
      (Red,Green,Blue) colour system and it is "additive" in that the three
      different colour strengths are added together to get the final colour.
      It takes 1 byte of computer memory to store each red, green and blue
      value, so a pixel uses 3 bytes of storage. This means the train image
      uses 600 x 337 (number of pixels) x 3 bytes of memory. This works out as
      606,600 bytes or 606.6kB and is a lot for such a comparatively small
      image. If images were stored in the device's permanent memory using this
      system it would quickly use up available memory. This was realised long
      ago and various methods were used to store image data more efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Compressed, uncompressed, lossey and lossless formats</h3>
    <p>
      Image data can be stored using methods that cleverly manipulate the
      pixel data so less of it needs to be stored. They are said to "compress"
      the data. This results in a lower file size than that which would occur
      if the data was not compressed (i.e. uncompressed).
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods that manipulate pixel data often do so by throwing away some
      of it. Because they do this they are called "lossey". However, some
      compression methods do not throw away data, and still manage a smaller
      file size. They are called "lossless". The various image formats use a
      combination of all of the above methods. An image's type (e.g. photo,
      icon, animation) determines the best format to use for storage.
      Following are the common image storage formats and a bit about them.
      Note: images use a file extension to identify their type. The file name
      is followed by a dot and a group of 3 or 4 letters e.g. jpg, jpeg, bmp,
      png, svg
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bitmap</strong>: File extension <em>bmp</em> - uses no
        compression, 24bits per pixel and is not lossey, however it results in
        large file sizes, Microsoft Paint uses this format by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JPEG</strong> (invented by the Joint Photographers Experts
        group to store photographs): File extensions <em>jpg </em>or
        <em>jpeg</em> - uses lossey 24 (RGB) or 32 bit (RGBA system)
        compression, is the most common format used for images on the web,
        used by most phones as it leads to efficient file sizes with little
        loss of quality, can handle 16 million plus different colour shades.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PNG</strong> (Portable Network Graphics): File extension
        <em>png</em> - comes in two flavours, 8 and 24 bits (1 byte and 3
        bytes), 8 bit version is lossey as it can only store 256 unique
        colours
        <strong>unless there are 256 or less unique colours in the image</strong>, 24 bit version is not, as like jpeg
        it can handle 16+ million
        colours. However, using the 24bit version results in large file sizes
        compared to jpeg, supports transparency - this means one colour in the
        image can be set to be transparent or see-through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GIF</strong>: File extension <em>gif</em>- similar to PNG 8
        bit version, can support simple animation, but not as efficient as
        PNG, proprietary format (copyright owned).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples of the different formats</h2>
    <p>
      Note that the three images of the sun going down appear to be the same
      quality, however note the different file sizes. It is obvious that the
      jpeg is the most efficient in terms of file size for this type of image
      i.e. one that has many colour shades.
