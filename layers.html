    <h1>Using Layers</h1>
    <p>
      Layers are an important part of advanced image editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is beneficial to liken an image to a cake in that additional layers
      can enhance it add to how good the cake is. A cake can have: one layer
      (e.g. a plain sponge), two (e.g. a plain sponge with jam on top), three
      (e.g. a sponge with jam on top and another sponge layer on top of that),
      or many (e.g. a sponge cake made up of two sponge layers with jam and
      whipped cream in between topped with more cream and slices of
      Kiwifruit!).
    </p>
    <p>Below are some examples of using layers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sepia image:</strong> An old black and white image that has a
        sepia effect applied using an orangish/brownish coloured layer on top
        of it, with a blending mode set to "Overlay".

      <li>
        <strong>Colour replacement: </strong>A pink coloured car whose body
        work is turned to green. Steps involved:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The pink colour has been selected with the Magic Wand set on "Add
            to" mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new empty layer has been added and positioned above the layer
            with the pink car on it.
          </li>
          <li>The new layer has been clicked to make it the active layer.</li>
          <li>
            The foreground colour in the edit tools menu has been set to
            green.
          </li>
          <li>
            The paint pot tool has been used to fill the selection (on the new
            layer)
          </li>
          <li>
            The blending mode for the top layer has been set to multiply.
          </li>
        </ol>

            defined, though a lot of the image is darker and will need further
            processing.

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi-layer image: </strong>This image is quite garish but it
        shows how several layers and adjustments can be used to create an
        interesting image. Here is an explanation of how the final image was
        arrived at:
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Layer 2" was created by applying a radial blue/orange gradient to
            an otherwise empty layer. The layer is selected, as can be seen by
            its slightly darker background, and a blending mode of "Pin Light"
            is applied to it. As the blue "mountain and moon" scene layer
            (Layer 1) is below it, it will be effected by the blending mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Layer 0" has had the blue sky above the hills selected using the
            Magic Wand and the selected pixels have been deleted. This allows
            the composite effect of the layers below this one to show through
            the transparent part of the image. In addition, Layer 0's
            saturation has been "cranked right up" and this results in an
            over-saturated lake and flamingoes scene.
          </li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <h2>Basic Operations</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      When an image is opened it opens as one layer. This can be seen in the
      layers dialog, which is on the right-hand side of Photopea. The dialog
      will be named <strong>Layer 0</strong> by default. The name can be
      changed by double-clicking on it and typing in the new name. If working
      with several layers it is a good idea to name them using descriptive
      names. Each layer has a thumbnail as well as a name. The thumbnail gives
      a good indication of what is on the layer. However, a text layer is
      different in that a big T replaces the thumbnail and the name of the
      layer is a truncated version of the text on the layer.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating and Deleting Layers</h3>
    <p>
      Creating a new layer can be done in several ways. Here are the three
      most common.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the New Layer button. It has an icon that looks like a piece of
        paper with a turned up edge, and is at the bottom right corner of
        Photopea. The new layer will be created and placed above the currently
        selected one and will be transparent. This is indicated by the layer's
        thumbnail, which has a checkerboard pattern. Note the buttons/icons in
        the same group as the New Layer one. They enable other layer
        operations such as deletion of the selected layer. Hover over an icon
        and a descriptive tool tip will pop up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click on an existing layer and choose "Duplicate" from the menu
        that pops up. This will copy the layer and position the copy on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Copying and pasting a selection. A new layer can be made from a
        selection by copying and pasting it. This can be done by going: 1)
        Select->All, 2) Edit->Copy, 3) Edit->Paste OR by using the key
        combinations Ctrl+c then Ctrl+v The new layer will be on top of the
        layer that the selection was active on and the selections, original
        and copied, will be aligned. The two images below show 1) the
        selection copied and 2) the selection moved. Note that the layer with
        the copied selection on it is likely to have transparent areas in it
        as well.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Deleting a layer</strong> can be done by clicking on the layer
      to select it, then by either clicking the rubbish bin icon or
      right-clicking and choosing delete from the pop-up menu.
    </p>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">
      <img loading="lazy" src="./img/layers/layers-adding-deleting.jpg" alt="Layer context menu" />
      <figcaption>
        Right-clicking on a layer brings up the context menu. Amongst other
        operations, the layer can be Deleted or Duplicated. The New Layer and
        Delete Layer buttons are at bottom right.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Moving Layers</h3>
    <p>
      When looking at a layered image what you see is the image arranged from
      the top layer downwards. It is often necessary to rearrange layers to
      get the effect that you desire. A layer's position can be changed by
      clicking and dragging on it.
    </p>

    <h3>Layer Effects</h3>
    <p>
      When a layer is active (i.e. selected by clicking on its thumbnail with
      the mouse) any operation, such as making a selection, applying a
      transform, or using the paint brush, will effect that layer only. It is
      a common error to be working on the wrong layer. If this occurs you can
      use the history feature to undo undesired changes. In the layers dialog
      several effects can be applied to a layer. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Change opacity or transparency i.e. make the layer more see-through
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes" target="_blank" title="blending modes">blending mode</a>
        so the pixels on the layer will change according to how they interact
        with the pixels on the layer below it. The most commonly used blends
        are multiply, overlay and screen. Multiply works by darkening a pixel
        if there is a corresponding dark pixel below it. This blend is often
        used to increase the definition of old faded images, and is done by
        duplicating the original layer and setting the blend mode to Multiply
        for the top one. Overlay and Screen can be used for old pictures as
        well to bring out detail and also to add a colour overlay such as a
        sepia effect. The opacity of the layer can be adjusted to fine-tune
        the blend effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer Styles. To open the Layer Style dialog right-click on a layer
        and choose "Blending Options" from the pop-up menu that appears. There
        are many options and each has its own set of adjustments. The image
        below shows several applied to an image. The styles can be adjusted at
        any time by right-clicking on a layer and opening the dialog again.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adjustment Layers and Masks</h2>
    <p>
      We will not be covering Adjustment Layers and Masks in the course as
      they are quite advanced. Adjustment layers are special types of layers
      that sit above the layer that needs adjusting. An adjustment, such as
      Black and white, is applied to the adjustment layer rather than the
      layer below it. In this way the "original" layer is left intact. Mask
      layers are special in that an effect or adjustment can be made then the
      mask can be painted on using a black, grey or white colour to remove,
      partially remove, or entirely remove the effect. The image below has
      been desaturated using the Black and white adjustment layer and then the
      mask has been painted on to remove some of the blurring.
