    <h1>The Text tool</h1>
    <p>
      The text tool can be used to add text to an image. As well as having a
      choice of many fonts, colours and sizes, blending options and
      transformations can be made.
    </p>
    <h2>Text tool options</h2>
    <p>
      The text tool has a large T on the button that activates it. Once it is
      clicked on the options for the tool are displayed in the options bar.
      The buttons with downward pointing arrows can be clicked on to show
      dropdown menus.
    </p>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">

      <figcaption>The text tool's options bar</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Font Families</h3>
    <p>
      There are many different fonts that can be used. Checking/unchecking the
      tick boxes will show and hide whole families of fonts. There is also a
      "Find" search box that can be used to quickly find a font. The star can
      be clicked to set a font as a "favourite" for easy future access.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Font families menu</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Font Size</h3>
    <p>
      The size of a font can be set by typing a number into the "Size" textbox
      or by dragging the slider.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Text font size control</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Text Colour</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the colour thumbnail will open a colour choosing dialog. Click
      on the vertical colour rainbow and drag up and down to display the
      colour options on the left side of the dialog. Click on it and drag the
      circle that appears to fine tune colour choice. Note that the RGB values
      for a colour are displayed as well as the Hue Saturation and Brightness
      values (HSB). HSB is an alternative way to describe colours. Click the
      "OK" button when happy with your choice.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Text colour choice dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Text Alignment and the Cha dialog</h3>
    <p>
      The three buttons to the right of the colour thumbnail in the options
      bar can be used to set text alignment. On the right, next to the
      "History" dialog is a button labeled "Cha". This is short for character.
      Clicking it will result in a dialog popping out. It can be used to
      fine-tune character options.
    </p>
    <h3>Entering Text</h3>
    <p>
      Once options (font, size, colour etc.) have been chosen click on the
      image where you want the text to start, and start typing. If you want
      text to break onto a new line hold down the Shift key and press Enter.
      When you have finished entering text click the "Tick" button in the text
      options bar or click on one of the other tools in the editing tool bar
      to exit text editing mode. If needs be the block of text can be moved by
      1) making sure the layer with the text on it is selected/highlighted in
      the layers dialog; 2) clicking on on the "Move" tool (arrow at top-left
      of tools pallette); 3) dragging the text to where you want it to be.
    </p>
    <h2>Highlighting text</h2>
    <p>
      To select or highlight text so it can be edited: 1) select the text
      layer that contains the text to be highlighted; 2) activate the text
      tool by clicking it; 3) click just to the left of the first character in
      the text; 4) drag across the text using the mouse. <br />A background
      colour will appear indicating which text characters are selected. Note
      that it is not necessary to select all characters in a string of text -
      but only the ones selected can be edited. Once the text is selected it
      can be edited e.g. change colour, size, font family.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Highlighting text so it can be edited</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Blending Options</h2>
    <p>
      Text can be styled by applying a number of effects. To do this:
      right-click on the text layer you want to apply effects to and choose
      "Blending Options" from the menu that appears.
    </p>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">

      <figcaption>Blending options menu item</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      A dialog like the one below appears. As can be seen, a variety of
      effects can be added. When an effect is chosen by clicking on the
      checkbox on its left, clicking on the effect name will cause the options
      for it to appear on the right-hand side of the dialog. The image below
      shows the options for the "Satin" effect. It is designed to give a shiny
      overlay. As the chosen colour is black the text has been darkened a
      little as well as being made shiny.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h2>Text Warping</h2>
    <p>
      Text can be warped into a number of shapes. To do so: select the text
      layer and the text tool (to bring up the options) and then click on the
      warp button in the options bar to show the warping dialog. To the right
      of the word "Style" is a button that should say "None". Click on this
      and a dropdown will appear showing what effects can be applied. There
      are also some sliders that can be adjusted to fine-tune the chosen warp
      effect. Click on the "Tick" button in the options bar to apply the
      effect.

    <h2>Transforming Text</h2>
    <h3>Rasterizing the layer</h3>
    <p>
      Text can being further changed by transforming its shape using the "Free
      Transform" tool. Text layers are different to ordinary layers in that
      they represent letter shapes using what are called vectors. This allows
      them to be scaled with no loss of definition or sharpness. The big "T"
      in the text layer's thumbnail indicates that it is a text layer. The
      name of the text layer is normally the text on the layer, though this
      can be changed (as any layer name can be) by double-clicking on the name
      and typing a new one.
    </p>

    <figure class="image-side-by-side">
      <img loading="lazy" src="./img/text-tool/text-layer-thumbnail.png" alt="Text layer thumbnail" />
      <figcaption>Standard Text layer thumbnail showing big T</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In order for the text to be transformed the layer it is on first must be
      rasterized. This changes the vectors that make up the text characters
      into grids of pixels. To do this, right-click on the layer and choose
      "Rasterize" from the menu that appears. Once this is done the look of
      the layer thumbnail changes to look more like a standard one. Note that
      once a text layer is rasterized the text on it can no longer be edited.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Rasterized layer thumbnail</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Using Free Transform</h3>
    <p>
      The menu items for the transform tools can be found under
      <strong>Edit</strong> on the main menu bar.
    </p>
    <figure class="image-side-by-side">
      <img loading="lazy" src="./img/text-tool/text-tool-free-transform.jpg" alt="Free Transform menu item" />
      <figcaption>Free Transform menu item</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The <strong>Transform</strong> and <strong>Free Transform</strong> tools
      can be used on any layer. The difference between the two transforms is
      that the first allows for standard operations such as: Flip Horizontal
      and Resize width and/or height. The second type of transform allows for
      distortions. For this demonstration the Free Transform tool is used.
      Once the tool is chosen from the dropdown menu a transform box complete
      with adjustment handles at its corners, along its sides and in the
      middle, appears around the text. To distort the text hold down the
      control key (Ctrl) and drag on one of the transform handles. As can be
      seen from the images below, the bottom left handle has been chosen and
      used to warp the text. Once you are happy with the change click on the
      big tick in the options bar or press the Enter key to apply the
      transformation.
